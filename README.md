# 🛡️ Sentinel AI: Tactical PII Neutralization Platform

Sentinel AI is a premium, enterprise-grade Privacy Operations Center (PrivOps). It is designed to automatically detect, hide, and manage Personally Identifiable Information (PII) across text, images, and large datasets with a sleek "Premium Obsidian & Cyber-Neon" interface.

## 🚀 Core Mission Nodes

### 📡 Neural Scanner (Live Privacy Shield)
The active workspace for immediate data cleansing.
- **Real-time Neutralization**: Instant detection of Aadhaar, PAN, Emails, Phones, UPI, and more.
- **Neural OCR Engine**: A persistent "always-ready" Tesseract worker that extracts text from images with zero initialization lag.
- **Vault Drafts**: Save your current analysis session and restore it later. Perfect for long security audits.
- **🧹 Custom Rules (Neural Patterns)**: **Why use this?** Because standard scanners miss your unique secrets. Define your own regex patterns to hide internal project codes, employee IDs, or proprietary data formats.

### 🛰️ Identity Radar (Intelligence Hub)
Your historical command center for privacy compliance.
- **Temporal Risk Heatmap**: A 24-hour visual grid showing when your data is most vulnerable.
- **Threat Distribution**: Real-time charts showing your top 5 most detected "security vectors."
- **📄 Sentinel Audit PDF**: **The Final Result.** Generate professional, industrial-grade PDF reports containing executive summaries and detailed scan logs for legal or compliance records.

### 📦 Bulk Node (Batch Data Cleaner)
**Why use this?** For "Industrial Scale" privacy. 
- **Volumetric Processing**: Instead of one-by-one, drop an **entire folder** or hundreds of log files.
- **ZIP Vault Export**: Sentinel cleanses everything in parallel and provides a single, secure ZIP archive of all your fully redacted documents.

## 🛠️ Tactical Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Vite (Industrial Glassmorphism & Cyber-Neon).
- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy (Secure SQLite Persistence).
- **Neural Layer**: Tesseract.js (Optimized Persistent Worker).
- **Security**: JWT Encryption + BCrypt Hashing + OS Native Notifications.
